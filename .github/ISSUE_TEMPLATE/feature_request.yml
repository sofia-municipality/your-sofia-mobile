        Add push notifications when air quality index exceeds a user-defined threshold:
        - User sets threshold in Profile settings (e.g., "Notify when AQI > 100")
        - Backend checks air quality data every 30 minutes
        - If threshold exceeded, send push notification with:
          - Current AQI value
          - Health recommendations
          - Link to detailed air quality map

      description: What other approaches have you thought about?
      placeholder: |
        - In-app banner only (less effective, requires app to be open)
        - Email notifications (slower, less immediate)
        - SMS notifications (expensive, privacy concerns)

      required: false

      placeholder: |
        - Backend: Add scheduled task to check air quality API
        - Database: Store user notification preferences (threshold values)
        - Frontend: Add settings screen for threshold configuration
        - Push: Use existing Expo notification infrastructure
        - Consider rate limiting to avoid notification spam
